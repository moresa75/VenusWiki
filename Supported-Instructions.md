At the moment, venus supports most of the [RV32IM standard](https://riscv.org/specifications/). 

`fence`, `fence.i` and cycle counter instructions are not fully implemented yet though you may be able to use some of them. Floating point and atomic extensions are also partially implemented though not finished yet.
