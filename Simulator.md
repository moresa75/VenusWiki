The Simulator is the main component of venus.

# Simulator Controls

The following controls are available:

* __Run__ / __Stop__: runs the program until it terminates. While running, the program can be stopped by clicking it again.
* __Step__: executes the highlighted instruction.
* __Prev__: undo the previously executed instruction.
* __Reset__: resets the simulator to its initial state (equivalent to reassembling the program).

# Program View

The program view displays the assembled program. It contains three columns:

* __Machine Code__: the machine code of the instruction in hexadecimal.
* __Basic Code__: the assembly code after pseudoinstruction expansion and linking.
* __Original Code__: the original code in the program.

## Debugging

The instruction which is about to be executed is highlighted in green.

In order to add a breakpoint, simply click on the instruction. This will cause the row to be highlighted red, indicating that a breakpoint has been set. To remove the breakpoint, click it again.

# Sidebar View

## Registers

The register tab displays the values of the current registers. The most recently changed register is highlighted in blue. In addition, the registers values can be edited.

## Memory

The memory tab shows the bytes currently in memory.

### Memory Controls

The __Jump to__ select box allows jumping to a [[memory segment|Memory Segments]].

The __Up / Down__ buttons scroll the memory view. __Up__ moves towards higher addresses, and __down__ moves towards lower addresses.

## Display Settings

The display settings can be used to change how values are displayed. By default, values are displayed in unsigned hexadecimal.

* __Hex__ (default) - display as unsigned hexadecimal.
* __Decimal__ - display as signed decimal.
* __Unsigned__ - display as unsigned decimal.
* __ASCII__ - display as ASCII character, surrounded by single quotes.
    * If the number is too big (not between 0 and 255), it is displayed as hex instead.
    * Anything which is in ASCII but not printable is displayed as the unicode replacement glyph: ï¿½

# Console Output

The console output is used for [[ecalls|Environmental Calls]] and displaying any errors which occur.
