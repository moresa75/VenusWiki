This tab will (eventually) help you design a custom url for Venus which will do magical stuff. It will allow you to set settings, load scripts, and set up the environment however you want to. I am still working on this so there are not too many details about it.

* `target` with a url will load the contents of the url into the editor
* `code` will load into the editor whatever it is set equal to.
* `override` will disable/enable the override prompt if you have save data in the editor on load with target or code set.
* `save` will set wether venus should save your data or not.
* `clear` if this is set to true, Venus will clear the LocalStorage and refresh.
