To use an environmental call, load the ID into register `a0`, and load any arguments into `a1` - `a7`. Any return values will be stored in argument registers.

The following environmental calls are currently supported.

| ID (`a0`)  | Name            | Description                                                         |
| ---------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1          | print_int       | prints integer in `a1`                                              |
| 4          | print_string    | prints the null-terminated string whose address is in `a1`          |
| 9          | sbrk            | allocates `a1` bytes on the heap, returns pointer to start in `a0`  |
| 10         | exit            | ends the program                                                    |
| 11         | print_character | prints ASCII character in `a1`                                      |
| 13         | openFile        | Opens the file in the VFS where a pointer to the path is in `a1` and the permission bits are in `a2`. Returns to a0 an integer representing the file descriptor.|
| 14         | readFile        | Takes in: `a1` = FileDescriptor, `a2` = Where to store the data (an array), `a3` = the amount you want to read from the file. Returns `a0` = Number of items which were read and put to the given array. If it is less than `a3` it is either an error or EOF. You will have to use another ecall to determine what was the cause. |
| 15         | writeFile       | Takes in: `a1` = FileDescriptor, `a2` = Buffer to read data from, `a3` = amount of the buffer you want to read, `a4` = Size of each item. Returns `a0` = Number of items written. If it is less than `a3` it is either an error or EOF. You will have to use another ecall to determine what was the cause. Also, you need to flush or close the file for the changes to be written to the VFS. |
| 16         | closeFile       | Takes in: `a1` = FileDescriptor. Returns 0 on success and EOF (-1) otherwise. Will flush the data as well. |
| 17         | exit2           | ends the program with return code in `a1`                           |
| 18         | fflush          | Takes in: `a1` = FileDescriptor. Will return 0 on success otherwise EOF on an error.  |
| 19         | feof            | Takes in: `a1` = FileDescriptor. Returns a nonzero value when the end of file is reached otherwise, it returns 0. |
| 20         | ferror          | Takes in: `a1` = FileDescriptor. Returns Nnnzero value if the file stream has errors occurred, ​0​ otherwise. |
| 34         | printHex        | prints hex in `a1`                                                  |

The environmental calls are intended to be somewhat backwards compatible with [SPIM's syscalls](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/lab/secondyear/spim/node8.html).

As an example, the following code prints the integer `42` to the console:

    addi a0 x0 1        # print_int ecall
    addi a1 x0 42       # integer 42
    ecall
