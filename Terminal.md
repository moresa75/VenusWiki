This is a new interface which I am working on which will allow you to do more with the Venus simulator with a friendly, similar interface which you may already be used to. You can still use the editor like normal but the terminal allows you to have full interactions with the [Virtual File System](Virtual-File-System). There will be more information here about the basic commands but you can use the `help` command to figure that stuff out as well.
